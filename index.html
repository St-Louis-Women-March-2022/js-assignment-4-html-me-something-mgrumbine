               <p>
                  Ale is the current alias of a loxodon (elephant person) monk named Broosuzh. He hails from a small village in the northern part of the island of Ebur'neos, but he left Ebur'neos approximately 300 years ago trying to outrun his past. His first stop upon leaving Eber'neos was an isolated monestary where he attempted to find peace and tranquility, as well as being trained in martial arts and receiving his first magical tattoo. But when even meditation guided by master monks could not silence his memories, he left again, seeking yet another means of forgetting. He's spent most of the last 300 years sailing around the Chimera Islands aboard an assortment of merchant and pirate vessels, drinking copious amounts of alcohol (in an attempt to drown what he could not forget), and collecting additional tattoos. He's just been kicked off yet another ship for being drunk while on duty, so he's currently looking for his next get-rich-quick scheme and/or his next crew.

               <p>
                  Angeldust is a one-foot-tall, purple, pixie fighter. She's lived her whole life in the village of Sylfame in the Moving Mountain. She was very popular among the young pixies of Sylfame, generally. Her can-do  attitude and her cheerful, mischievous personality aided her in making friends. She spent most of her time hanging out with a small circle of close friends whose tricksy pixie ways led to them engaging in a prank war with a rival group of pixie friends. Recently, she was flitting about outside of the mountain when she was caught in a sudden, strong storm that swept her far away from home. With no knowledge of where she is or how to return home, Angeldust is trying to make the best of the situation she's found herself in.

               <h2 id="mainheading">b'Rong</h2>
               <p>
                  b'Rong is a grung (frog-person) paladin devoted to h'Qet (know as Heqet to everyone who isn't grung), the goddess of life and spring. He has always been an outcast in grung society, which operates under a strict, skin-color-based caste system, due to the fact that he is obviously a blend of blue, one of the lower castes (which he gets from his mother), and orange (one of the upper castes). b'Rong was shockingly selected to join the grung chapter of the Order of the White Lotus, the paladin order devoted to h'Qet. Membership in the grung chapter is gerenerally limited to the members of the upper castes. In what would have been an insult to any other grung paladin of the White Lotus, b'Rong was sent to guard a side gate of a small White Lotus fortification in the furthest reaches of the grung empire. When a raiding party of bullywugs (slightly different frog people) attacked the side gate, b'Rong successfully held them off single-handedly. Recognizing that grung leadership would never see the truth that bullywugs were capable of organizing and posing a threat and recognizing that b'Rong's outcast status and his battle prowess made b'Rong particularly suited for the task, b'Rong's mentor, c'Utta, sent him to seek help from the Chimera Tribunal, which holds court for all islands in the Chimera Compact, from its seat on the island of Ebur'neos.

               <p>
                  Chaddeus Thundercock, an aasimar (half-angel) bard, had a picturesque childhood half a world away, on the continent of Durangard. His single-parent father doted on him while crafting world-class lutes. Unfortunately,  Chaddeus's picturesque childhood came grinding to a screeching halt when his father was murdered and his father's favorite lute and most prized possession was stolen. Chaddeus now roams the world seeking clues about the whereabouts of the stolen lute, while trying to make a name for himself as a world-class musician.

               <h2 id="subheading5">Cleaner</h2>
               <p>
                  Cleaner is one of 6 automatons created by the Artificer's Guild in the city of Le'otus. She and her sisters were officially created to handle menial tasks for the guild, such as cleaning, but, secretly, the artificer who created them started using them for more nefarious purposes, such as stealing. The local Thieve's Guild did not appreciate being blamed for the sub-par thievery of the 6 atomaton rogues. In retaliation, the Thieve's Guild attacked the Artificer's guildhall. A portion of the guildhall was set ablaze and fell in, trapping Cleaner and her sisters. A young artificer dug through the burning rubble and managed to free Cleaner, but lost his arm in the process. Cleaner's sisters, sadly, all died in the attack and Cleaner's emotional control circuitry was badly damaged. Cleaner is now prone to uncontrollable fits of weeping, as extreme sadness seems to be the only emotional circuit that is still functional. Cleaner is also attached to the young artificer who saved her and follows him anywhere he goes.

               <h2 id="subheading6">Gimdir</h2>
               <p>
                  Gimdir is a firbolg barbarian from the remote island of Grand Tego. The firbolgs of Grand Tego had very little contact with people from other islands. They spent much of their lives caring for the forests of Tego Wood. Gimdir's tribe was known, locally, for their skill with tree songs which encourage the forests to grow strong. Gimdir had no knack for the songs nor a strong connection with the forest itself. He had, however, taken to the role of tribal protector. He guarded his tribe well for many years against wild beasts and any other threats that loomed before his tribe. One night, fire came into their village. Gimdir struggled to put out the fire and save those he could. Unfortunately, he blacked out. When he awoke, his entire village lay in ashes. Only bones remained of Gimdir's tribe, including his wife and daughter. He has wandered the wilderness of Grand Tego for nearly 50 years since he lost his family. He could no longer bear the sadness of being near the place of his tragedy and boarded a ship, seeking to make a home elsewhere.

               <h2 id="subheading7">Gothun</h2>
               <p>
                  Gothun Prideless is a leonin (lion-person) artificer from the city of Le'otus. He was orphaned and spent some time as a street urchin before being taken in by the Artificer's Guild, due to his natural curiosity and knack for creating small gadgets. When the Guild was attacked by the Thieve's Guild, he went into the burning part of the building and managed to rescue Cleaner, but his arm was so badly injured in the process that he ended up losing that arm. He and a fellow artificer have been working to create a prosthetic replacement, and it is almost finished. He is seeking to better himself, both physically and mentally, in order to become the best artificer.

               <h2 id="subheading8">Joje</h2>
               <p>
                  Joje is a simic (genetically-altered fish person) bloodhunter. He has left his home beneath the waves to deliver a message honoring an ancient treaty. He has decided to remain on the surface after delivering the message to the Chimera Tribunal in Ebur'neos in order toexperience what he can of this alien locale.

               <h2 id="subheading9">Khigeella</h2>
               <p>
                  Khigeella Gemeyes is a svirfneblin (underground gnome) druid. She was raised in the city of Solvtarn on the continent of Gersemi by very protective parents. One of her private tutors was a druid, who sparked her interest in druidcraft. Now, as an almost-adult by svirfneblin standards, she's been tasked with sailing halfway around the world to the Chimera Islands to apprentice with a powerful druid and help keep balance in the natural world.
